**Compiled:** 25 February 2026
**Purpose:** Background research for formal PDF report on the THG Studios x Topshop "Runway to the Future" event

---

## Topic 1: Topshop History -- Rise, Fall, and Resurgence

### 1.1 Origins and Early History (1960s--1970s)

- **1964:** Topshop was launched as a youth fashion section within the Sheffield department store Peter Robinson, owned by Raymond Montague Burton. The brand targeted the emerging generation of mod-influenced, style-conscious young women.
- The department initially stocked garments by designers such as Mary Quant and Gerald McCann, described as high fashion for the "young and different generation."
- **1974:** Topshop became a standalone brand under the Burton Group (later renamed Arcadia Group).
- **1978:** Topshop accounted for a third of Burton's operating profits.

### 1.2 The Philip Green / Arcadia Group Era (1990s--2010s)

#### Oxford Circus Flagship
- **1992:** Topshop and Topman joined forces to open the Oxford Street flagship store, which they claimed was the largest fashion store in the world.
- **1994:** The iconic Oxford Circus flagship was fully realised, complete with DJ booths and in-house nail bars, establishing it as a fashion pilgrimage destination.
- The flagship, known as "Big Topshop," was a sprawling **90,000 square feet** and became the jewel in Philip Green's Arcadia crown.

#### Philip Green's Acquisition
- **2002:** Philip Green acquired Arcadia Group -- which owned Topshop, Topman, Burton, Miss Selfridge, Dorothy Perkins, Wallis, Evans, and Outfit -- for **GBP 850 million**.
- At its peak, Arcadia had more than **2,500 outlets** in the UK and Topshop had **500 stores around the world**, including **300 in the UK**.

#### Peak Popularity and Key Collaborations
- **2005--2007:** The Kate Moss collaboration launched. The supermodel's capsule collections drew queues outside stores and international media attention. Kate Moss posed in a slinky, floor-sweeping red gown in the shop window to mark the launch, literally stopping traffic as crowds spilled onto the road. Shoppers queued for **up to five hours** at the Oxford Circus flagship. The pieces ranged from vintage-inspired dresses and tailored jackets to slim-cut trousers, all of which sold out quickly and became collector's items. This collaboration helped pioneer the now-common model of high-profile designer or celebrity collaborations on the high street.
- **2009:** Topshop became the first high street brand to show at London Fashion Week, debuting its premium "Topshop Unique" line.
- **2014--2018:** Beyonce and Philip Green launched the **Ivy Park** activewear line as a 50/50 joint venture (launched April 2016). In November 2018, following allegations of sexual misconduct against Green, Beyonce's company Parkwood Entertainment acquired 100% of Ivy Park, severing ties with Topshop.

#### Cultural Significance
- Topshop was described as "more than just a store; it was a cultural institution" and "a rite of passage for every British teen."
- The brand defined "cool-girl fashion" for decades and became synonymous with trend-led, affordable British retail.
- Topshop's iconic products included the Jamie jeans, Joni jeans, and the Baxter jeans -- defining silhouettes for a generation of young women.

### 1.3 The Collapse: Arcadia Group Administration (November 2020)

- Over **400 retail stores** had their future called into question.
- Deloitte was appointed as administrator.
- The collapse was attributed to: declining high street sales, failure to invest in digital infrastructure, the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns, and controversies surrounding Philip Green.
