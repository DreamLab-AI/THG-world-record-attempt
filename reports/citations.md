The broader fashion technology market (AI + AR + VR + blockchain) is projected at $345 billion by 2030 (RetailBoss). The report should specify which market definition is being used.

**Status:** VERIFIED for AI in media/entertainment (~$99.48B by 2030). The projection does not apply narrowly to "AI in fashion" alone.

## Items Without Verifiable Public Sources

The following claims in the report could not be independently verified through public web sources:

1. **University of Salford as venue or co-producer** -- All press coverage identifies THG Studios, Manchester as the venue. The University of Salford's role may be in the UKRI consortium but is not publicly documented in relation to the catwalk event.

2. **Freepik Spaces used specifically by THG for the Agentic Catwalk workflow** -- Freepik Spaces is verified as a real platform, but no public source confirms THG's specific use of it for this event.

3. **DreamLab AI as part of the UKRI Agentic AI Pioneers Prize consortium** -- DreamLab AI is verified as a real, active UK company. Their participation in the UKRI prize is stated in the report but not independently verifiable through public search results (prize participant lists are not publicly available).

4. **The specific "4-hour build time / 15-minute per-asset generation" baseline** -- This appears to be internal THG project data shared with the IRIS team, not publicly available.

## Recommended Report Corrections

Based on this citation research, the following corrections are recommended for the main report:

1. **Event name:** The official event name in press materials is "Runway to the Future" (not "Agentic Catwalk"). Consider using the official name with "Agentic Catwalk" as an internal/project descriptor.

2. **Event venue:** All press sources confirm THG Studios, Manchester as the venue, not the University of Salford. The University of Salford may be a consortium partner but is not the event venue.

3. **250+ brands:** The THG Ingenuity "250+" figure refers to delivery partners, not brands served. The report text should clarify this or use a different metric.

4. **Revenue claim:** The "annual revenues exceeding 1 billion" likely refers to Arcadia Group consolidated turnover, not Topshop standalone. Consider clarifying.

5. **AI market projection:** The ~$100 billion figure is for AI in media and entertainment broadly, not AI in fashion specifically. The AI-in-fashion-specific market is projected at $9-19 billion by 2030.

6. **THG stock ticker:** Since the January 2025 demerger, THG plc (LSE: THG) and THG Ingenuity are separate entities. THG Ingenuity is now a private company.
