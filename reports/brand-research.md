## 3. Freepik Spaces

### What It Is

Freepik Spaces is a cloud-based, infinite canvas creative environment launched in November 2025 as part of Freepik's AI Creative Suite. It provides a node-based interface to build, automate, and collaborate using AI workflows -- consolidating image generation, video creation, audio, retouching, and upscaling into a single collaborative workspace.

### How It Works

**Node-Based Workflow System:**
- Nodes are the building blocks of each workflow
- Each node performs a specific task (uploading, generating, processing)
- Users connect nodes visually to create end-to-end creative pipelines
- Outputs from one node feed directly into subsequent nodes
- Changing one element propagates updates through connected downstream nodes

### Available Node Types

| Text Node | Add prompts, comments, and text input |
| Assistant Node | AI-powered text generation |

| Image Upscaler | Enhance resolution using Magnific technology |
| List Node | Batch processing (e.g., translating ads into multiple languages) |

### Key Features

- **AI Model Selection:** Multiple AI models available via drop-down menu within each node
- **Real-Time Collaboration:** Shared workspaces (similar to Figma) where multiple users can work simultaneously
- **Templates:** Ready-to-use templates for ad adaptation/animation, brand identity creation, product variations, social media posts, and model swapping in campaigns
- **Browser-Based:** No hardware requirements; works on any laptop or PC
- **Mobile Support:** Accessible on desktop and mobile via freepik.com/spaces

### Enterprise Features

- Product photography variations
- Social media content generation
- Brand identity creation and iteration
