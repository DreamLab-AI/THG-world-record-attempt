% ============================================================
\section{Executive Summary}

On February 25, 2026, the IRIS autonomous campaign generation system attempted to set a world record for AI-generated fashion advertising. Starting from a single four-panel garment photograph---Look~6 from the Topshop SS26 collection---an autonomous AI agent swarm produced over 100 production-ready campaign assets in approximately 60 minutes of wall-clock time.

Critically, this was achieved \textbf{from a standing start in 3 hours on-site at THG}---no pre-built workflows, no pre-existing assets, no creative brief. The system was pointed at a garment photograph and given voice instructions. Everything---the pipeline architecture, multi-GPU configuration, API integrations, creative direction, asset generation, quality assurance, documentation, and this formal report---was produced within that 3-hour window using a mix of local GPU compute and cloud AI services.

This work builds on a workflow pioneered by THG Ingenuity for the \textbf{Agentic Catwalk} event in February 2026. That original workflow, built within Freepik Spaces, required approximately 4 hours of expert setup time and produced assets at a rate of roughly 15 minutes per image. The IRIS system agentically recreated and expanded this workflow, achieving:

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item \textbf{8--14$\times$ speedup} over the traditional 4-hour expert pipeline
    \item \textbf{133+ assets} from 16 voice prompts totaling $\sim$5 minutes of human input
    \item \textbf{Peak generation rate} of 4.4 images/minute during parallel swarm execution
    \item \textbf{Zero manual Photoshop} --- all compositing, typography, and formatting automated
\end{itemize}

The dress---a cream sleeveless maxi with black ink botanical chrysanthemum illustrations on the bodice, thin vertical pinstripes on the A-line skirt, and thin chain link straps---remained the single constant element across all outputs, placed into environments spanning brutalist architecture, neon corridors, surreal smiley-filled voids, underwater dreamscapes, and more.

% 2. TOPSHOP: RISE, FALL, AND RESURGENCE
% ============================================================
\section{Topshop: Rise, Fall, and Resurgence}

\subsection{The Rise of a British Icon (1964--2015)}

Topshop began in 1964 as a concession within Sheffield's Peter Robinson department store, quickly establishing itself as the destination for trend-driven, affordable fashion on the British high street. By the 1990s and 2000s, under the Arcadia Group and Sir Philip Green, Topshop had become a global fashion phenomenon.

The brand's Oxford Circus flagship store in London---spanning over 90,000 square feet across five floors---became one of the most visited fashion destinations in the world. At its peak, Topshop operated over 500 stores across 37 countries, with annual revenues exceeding \pounds 1 billion. The brand's ``Topshop Unique'' runway shows during London Fashion Week cemented its position at the intersection of high street and high fashion.

Celebrity collaborations with Kate Moss (2007--2014) and Beyonc\'{e} generated massive cultural impact, while designer partnerships brought runway aesthetics to accessible price points.

\subsection{The Collapse (2018--2020)}

The decline was swift and multifactorial:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item Rising competition from fast-fashion e-commerce (ASOS, Boohoo, Shein)
    \item Shifting consumer behavior away from high street retail
    \item Controversies surrounding Sir Philip Green
    \item The COVID-19 pandemic delivering the final blow
\end{itemize}

In November 2020, Arcadia Group entered administration, affecting approximately 13,000 jobs. Topshop's physical retail empire---once the envy of the fashion industry---ceased to exist.

\subsection{Acquisition and Digital Rebirth (2021--Present)}

In February 2021, ASOS acquired the Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge, and HIIT brands for \pounds 265 million ($\sim$\$330 million), marking one of the most significant digital-first brand acquisitions in British fashion history. Under ASOS ownership, Topshop pivoted to an online-only model.

By 2024--2026, the brand has undergone a deliberate repositioning:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item New creative direction emphasizing editorial quality
    \item Technology-forward campaigns leveraging AI and generative tools
    \item Partnership with THG Ingenuity for technology infrastructure
    \item Revival of the ``Style Reimagined'' brand messaging
\end{itemize}

\subsection{THG Ingenuity and the Technology Partnership}

THG (The Hut Group) operates one of the world's most advanced end-to-end e-commerce technology platforms through its \textbf{THG Ingenuity} division. This proprietary platform provides:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item Global e-commerce infrastructure
    \item Content creation and management tools
    \item AI-powered product imagery and campaign generation
    \item Studio and production automation
\end{itemize}

THG Ingenuity's partnership with brands like Topshop represents the convergence of heritage fashion with cutting-edge technology---precisely the space where the Agentic Catwalk event and this world record attempt operate.

% ============================================================
% 3. THE AGENTIC CATWALK
% ============================================================
\section{The Agentic Catwalk Event}

\subsection{THG Ingenuity's Vision}

In February 2026, THG Ingenuity staged the \textbf{Agentic Catwalk}---an event demonstrating how autonomous AI systems could generate complete fashion advertising campaigns. The event showcased a workflow built within \textbf{Freepik Spaces}, an AI image generation platform, that could produce professional campaign assets from garment photographs.

The original THG workflow characteristics:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item \textbf{Build time:} Approximately 4 hours for an expert to construct the pipeline
    \item \textbf{Generation rate:} $\sim$15 minutes per asset through the pipeline
    \item \textbf{Platform:} Freepik Spaces (cloud-based AI image generation)
    \item \textbf{Output:} Fashion campaign images suitable for e-commerce and social media
\end{itemize}

\subsection{From Freepik Spaces to IRIS}

The IRIS system was designed to agentically recreate and dramatically improve upon this workflow. Where the THG pipeline requires expert human operation at each step, IRIS deploys autonomous AI agents that:
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
    \item Interpret natural language voice instructions
    \item Self-organize into specialized agent swarms
    \item Select and orchestrate multiple AI generation engines
    \item Perform quality assurance autonomously
    \item Handle iteration and error recovery without human intervention
\end{enumerate}

% 4. THE IRIS SYSTEM
% ============================================================
\section{The IRIS System}

\subsection{Architecture Overview}

IRIS (\textbf{I}ntelligent \textbf{R}eal-time \textbf{I}ntegrated \textbf{S}tudio) is a voice-controlled AI system developed by \textbf{DreamLab AI Consulting Ltd} that works alongside creative teams rather than replacing them. Built on \textbf{VisionFlow}---an open-source GPU-accelerated knowledge graph engine (168,000 lines of Rust, MPL-2.0 licensed)---IRIS combines neuro-symbolic AI reasoning with autonomous agent orchestration for creative production workflows.

\subsubsection{The UKRI Agentic AI Pioneers Prize}

This world record attempt forms part of the development phase for the \textbf{UKRI Agentic AI Pioneers Prize}, a programme funded by Innovate UK. The project is a three-party consortium:

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item \textbf{DreamLab AI Consulting Ltd} (Lead): Platform development, agent architecture, OWL~2 ontology engineering
    \item \textbf{THG Ingenuity} (Partner): Creative studio environment, brand workflows, commercial route-to-market
    \item \textbf{University of Salford} (Collaborator): Creative industries research, user evaluation, catwalk co-production
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Technology Readiness Level Progression}

The fashion catwalk event on 25--26 February 2026 at the University of Salford represents a critical TRL validation milestone. The system has progressed from \textbf{TRL~4} (component validation) through \textbf{TRL~5} (validation within THG's creative production context) to \textbf{TRL~6} (full system demonstration in a relevant operational environment). This world record attempt stress-tests the complete pipeline---from voice brief through agent-driven asset generation---in a live production setting.

\subsubsection{Core Architecture}

IRIS implements a five-layer architecture: Presentation (React~19 + Three.js, WebXR), Compute (Rust/Actix-web, 100+ CUDA kernels), Knowledge (Neo4j + PostgreSQL + Qdrant unified under OWL~2 semantics), Agent (101 MCP skills via Claude-Flow coordinator), and Generative (containerised ComfyUI on local GPU). The core innovation is neuro-symbolic: agents reason over a formal OWL~2 ontology \emph{before} execution, rejecting semantically invalid proposals at the validation gate.

Three features distinguish IRIS: all generation runs on the studio's own hardware (IP sovereignty), creative workflows are captured as structured searchable knowledge (not unstructured files), and a human approves every client-facing output.

\begin{tcolorbox}[metricbox, title=IRIS System Architecture --- World Record Configuration]
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item \textbf{Orchestration:} Claude Flow v3 Hierarchical Swarm
    \item \textbf{Local GPU:} 2$\times$ NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada (48GB VRAM each)
    \item \textbf{Local Engine:} Flux 2 Dev FP8 via ComfyUI Multi-GPU
    \item \textbf{Cloud Engines:} Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (Nano Banana), Veo 3.1
    \item \textbf{Compositing:} PIL/Pillow programmatic rendering
    \item \textbf{Input Method:} Voice-captured natural language prompts
    \item \textbf{Max Parallel Agents:} 5 simultaneous (up to 50+ supported)
    \item \textbf{Platform:} VisionFlow (168K LoC Rust, MPL-2.0)
\end{itemize}
\end{tcolorbox}

\subsubsection{Voice-Captured Prompt Interface}

A critical distinction of the IRIS system is that all operator instructions were \textbf{voice-captured}---spoken naturally by the human creative director and transcribed into the system. This is not CLI input or typed commands; it represents the nominal operating mode for IRIS, where the creative director provides high-level artistic direction verbally, and the AI swarm handles all technical execution.

This voice-first approach means:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item Instructions are conversational and high-level, not technical
    \item The operator never writes code, API calls, or configuration files
    \item Each prompt averages $\sim$2 sentences of natural language
    \item The system interprets intent and autonomously determines implementation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Multi-GPU Pipeline}

The local generation pipeline distributes Flux 2 Dev across dual RTX 6000 Ada GPUs:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{GPU} & \textbf{Component} & \textbf{VRAM} \\
\midrule
cuda:0 & Flux 2 Dev UNet (fp8mixed) & $\sim$38 GB \\
cuda:1 & Mistral 3 Small CLIP (fp8) + Flux 2 VAE & $\sim$19 GB \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Multi-GPU VRAM distribution via ComfyUI-MultiGPU custom nodes}
\end{table}

\subsection{Agent Swarm Composition}

The IRIS system deployed agents in two waves:

\textbf{Wave 1 --- Core Pipeline (4 agents):}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item \textbf{Creative Director:} Typography research, shot concepts, prompt library
    \item \textbf{Pipeline Executor:} 4-phase generation across 3 engines (142+ tool calls)
    \item \textbf{Brand Guardian:} Autonomous QA evaluation against brand criteria
    \item \textbf{Workflow Researcher:} API documentation and workflow guides
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Wave 2 --- Scene Riffs (5 agents):}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item \textbf{Scene Cleaner:} Remove mannequins from reference scenes, preserve environments
    \item \textbf{Direct Composite:} Place dress into scene environments (9 images)
    \item \textbf{Creative Riff:} Surreal editorial variations (10 images)
    \item \textbf{Expanded Riffs:} High-concept diverse variations (15 images)
    \item \textbf{Flux 2 Local:} GPU-rendered editorial scenes (8 images)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Wave 3 --- Mannequin Repose (3 agents + 1 research):}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item \textbf{IRIS PDF Research:} Extract TRL/system context from 6 appendix documents
    \item \textbf{Repose Batch 1:} Images 1--10, alternating pose 24/26 (10 images)
    \item \textbf{Repose Batch 2:} Images 11--23, skipping ref 24 (13 images)
    \item \textbf{Repose Batch 3:} Images 25, 27--30, skipping ref 26 (5 images)
\end{itemize}

\section{The Garment: Topshop SS26 Look 6}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.3\textwidth}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.28\textwidth]{garment_reference.jpg}
    \caption{Garment reference: Look 6 front panel. The cream sleeveless maxi with botanical ink bodice, thin vertical pinstripes, and chain link straps.}
    \label{fig:garment}
\end{wrapfigure}

The entire campaign was generated from a single four-panel garment photograph showing front, right side, back, and left side views of \textbf{Look 6} from the Topshop SS26 collection.

\textbf{Garment details:}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item Cream/warm beige sleeveless maxi dress
    \item Delicate black ink botanical illustrations on the bodice: chrysanthemum flowers, bird silhouettes, flowing stems
    \item Thin vertical pinstripes on the flowing A-line skirt
    \item Thin chain link straps
    \item Natural, warm fabric tone
\end{itemize}

The four-panel composite was programmatically cropped into individual panels, with the front panel serving as the primary reference for all generation passes. The bottom 8\% of each panel was removed to exclude garment labels.

This single garment photograph served as the \textbf{sole creative input}. Every scene, environment, lighting condition, pose, and editorial concept was generated by the IRIS system from voice prompts alone.

\vspace{0.5cm}

% ============================================================
% 6. VOICE PROMPTS --- COMPLETE RECORD
% ============================================================
\section{Voice Prompts --- Complete Record}

All creative direction was provided as \textbf{voice-captured natural language prompts}. The operator spoke these instructions naturally; they were not typed CLI commands. This is the nominal input method for the IRIS system---a human creative director providing high-level artistic direction while the autonomous swarm handles all technical execution.

\begin{tcolorbox}[voiceprompt, title=Voice Prompt 1: Campaign Launch]
\small\itshape
``Generate a complete Topshop SS26 advertising campaign from a single garment photograph.

\begin{tcolorbox}[voiceprompt, title=Voice Prompt 12: Formal Report with Research]
\small\itshape
``Use Perplexity research agents to create a narrative about Topshop, its market crash and resurgence. When you have the history and vibe of Topshop you should look up the Agentic Catwalk event by THG Ingenuity in Feb 2026 and build information on that. This work is based on a THG workflow built in Freepik Spaces, which took 4 hours to build and has a 15 minute run per asset. The world record attempt today has used our system called IRIS to agentically recreate the workflow, and create assets for the world record event. Use the notes you have about the development we have undertaken, and Topshop and THG branding downloaded from the web.

``Two new tasks for the swarm. I have added much more context on IRIS. I am demonstrating progression from TRL4 to TRL6 for this THG and Topshop catwalk event. All the context for my IRIS system including the correct name and my interest is in those PDFs which you should research. Use that knowledge to add to the report without being overwhelming as this report targets multi audiences. Also, there's a new image task. We have a new folder called task-two-repose. We need to use our tooling to repose each image to match the stance of either of the new images 24 or 26, keeping all else the same for the images. This is likely a Nano Banana task and should be done at 2K resolution in the appropriate aspect for the task. When you have validated those results you can push. Update all the documentation accordingly for this new evolved context and additional work, this still fits in the original 3 hours.''
\end{tcolorbox}
\textbf{Result:} IRIS PDF research agent deployed across 6 appendix documents. 3 parallel repose agents launched, producing 28 reposed mannequin images. Report updated with IRIS/TRL context. All documentation updated.

\textbf{Duration:} 7 minutes (10:38--10:45 UTC)\\
\textbf{Output:} 18 composites (6 shots $\times$ 3 aspect ratios)

\begin{table}[H]

\textbf{Text Rendering Discovery:} AI-generated text via Nano Banana consistently misspelled ``REIMAGINED'' (producing ``REIMANGEED'', ``REIM ANGNED'', etc.). The solution was programmatic font rendering using Pillow, guaranteeing pixel-perfect typography. This finding informed all subsequent compositing.

\subsection{Phase 4: Animation (Veo 3.1)}

\textbf{Engine:} Veo 3.1 (\texttt{veo-3.1-generate-preview})\\
\textbf{Duration:} 5 minutes (10:45--10:50 UTC)\\
\textbf{Output:} 6 animated fashion films (8 seconds each)

Videos were generated via the \texttt{predictLongRunning} API endpoint using a 7-layer prompting framework (camera + lens + subject + action + setting + lighting + style).

\subsection{Phase 4b: Garment Fidelity Reskinning}

\textbf{Duration:} 22 minutes (10:55--11:17 UTC)\\
\textbf{Output:} 6 reskinned images + 18 composited variants

After Voice Prompt 2 identified that AI-generated garments had bold diagonal stripes instead of thin vertical pinstripes, the system:
\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
    \item Cropped the 4-panel garment image into individual panels
    \item Sent each scene image paired with the front panel reference to Nano Banana
    \item Generated garment-faithful reskins with correct pinstripe orientation
    \item Applied programmatic text overlay across 3 aspect ratios
\end{enumerate}

% 8b. PHASE 6: MANNEQUIN REPOSE
% ============================================================
\section{Phase 6: Mannequin Repose --- Pose Matching at Scale}

\subsection{The Repose Challenge}

A set of 30 chrome mannequin images---each wearing a distinct outfit in a concrete studio environment---needed to be reposed to match one of two target poses while preserving the exact outfit, accessories, shoes, and bags. This is a common production task in fashion e-commerce: maintaining garment consistency while varying model poses across a campaign.

\begin{figure}[H]

Pose 26 shows a dynamic walking stride with weight shifted forward. Each reposed output preserves the exact outfit from its source image while adopting the target pose.}
\label{fig:repose_refs}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Technical Approach: Dual-Image Nano Banana}

The repose pipeline uses the same dual-image Nano Banana pattern developed during Phase~4b garment reskinning---sending two images (source outfit + pose reference) together to Gemini 2.5 Flash Image with a structured prompt:

\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
    \item \textbf{Image 1 (source):} The mannequin whose outfit must be preserved exactly
    \item \textbf{Image 2 (pose reference):} The mannequin whose body pose must be matched
    \item \textbf{Prompt:} Instructs the model to take the exact outfit from Image~1 and apply the exact pose from Image~2
\end{enumerate}

A new ComfyUI workflow (\texttt{nano-banana-repose.json}) was created for this task, using \texttt{LoadImage} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{ImageBatch} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{GeminiImageNode} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{SaveImage}.

\subsection{Parallel Execution: 3-Agent Batch Processing}

28 images were distributed across three parallel agents (images 24 and 26 excluded as they serve as pose references):

\begin{table}[H]

\end{figure}

The repose phase adds 28 production-ready assets to the campaign total, bringing the deliverable count to \textbf{128+ assets}---all generated within the 3-hour on-site window.

\subsection{Key Technical Discoveries}

\begin{enumerate}[nosep]
    \item \textbf{Veo 3.1 API:} The \texttt{generateVideo} endpoint returns 404; use \texttt{predictLongRunning} instead. Video downloads require \texttt{-L} flag for HTTP redirects.
    \item \textbf{AI Text Rendering:} Nano Banana consistently misspells complex words. Programmatic rendering (Pillow) guarantees accuracy.
    \item \textbf{Multi-Panel References:} Sending a full 4-panel garment image causes grid/collage output. Single-panel crops are essential.
    \item \textbf{Garment Fidelity:} Flux 2 Dev text prompts alone cannot reliably reproduce specific garment details. Image reference via Nano Banana is required for fidelity.
    \item \textbf{Parallel Agent Throughput:} 5 simultaneous agents achieve 4.4 images/minute peak rate.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}

The IRIS system demonstrated that autonomous AI agent swarms can dramatically accelerate fashion campaign production while maintaining creative quality and brand compliance. Key achievements:

\begin{itemize}[nosep]
    \item \textbf{133+ assets} generated from garment photographs and mannequin images
    \item \textbf{8--14$\times$ speedup} over the traditional 4-hour expert workflow
    \item \textbf{16 voice prompts} ($\sim$5 minutes of human input) drove the entire campaign
    \item \textbf{Autonomous error recovery:} text misspelling, garment fidelity, and multi-panel issues were identified and resolved by the system
    \item \textbf{Creative diversity:} 45+ unique editorial concepts spanning architecture, nature, pop culture, cyberpunk, surrealism, and more
    \item \textbf{Multi-engine orchestration:} seamless coordination of local GPU (Flux 2 Dev), cloud image (Nano Banana), cloud video (Veo 3.1), and programmatic rendering
    \item \textbf{Pose-matching at scale:} 28 mannequin images reposed to target stances with 100\% success rate and zero retries
\end{itemize}

This world record attempt validates the TRL~4$\rightarrow$6 progression for IRIS---demonstrating the full system in a relevant operational environment as part of the UKRI Agentic AI Pioneers Prize development phase. It confirms the vision behind THG Ingenuity's Agentic Catwalk: AI-driven campaign generation is not merely faster than traditional workflows---it enables a qualitatively different creative process where human creative directors provide high-level voice direction while autonomous systems handle the full technical execution pipeline.

IRIS---built on the open-source VisionFlow platform by DreamLab AI, in partnership with THG Ingenuity and the University of Salford---represents a sovereign, explainable AI capability for creative studios. All generation ran on local GPU hardware; brand assets never left the building. The human creative director approved every output; the AI proposed, the person decided.

The future of fashion advertising lies at this intersection of human creativity and machine capability.
